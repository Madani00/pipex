# should work
- PATH=NULL ./pipex filein "/bin/cat" "/bin/cat" fileout
- when you pass path = "." , "./" , "/" . execve(path, cmd1_op, env) the function fails so no need to handle it
 ./pipex /dev/stdin "cat" "wc -l" /dev/stdout
 ./pipex file1 "echo 'hello world'" "grep hello" file2
 ./pipex /dev/random cat "head -n 5" file2
 ./pipex file1 "sleep 3" "sleep 1" file2               <--- sleep 4 seconds

# should not work
- ./pipex filein cat /ls /dev/stdout
- ./pipex filein cat ls /dev/stdout    (unset path, and you put ls exe in yr directory, but if you /bin/ls should work)



# attention
- PATH=NULL ./pipex filein "cat" "cat" fileout  (this way you are just putting the 'NULL' in the PATH variable, it never sets the path to empty)
- valgrind ./pipex filein " " "ldfs" /dev/stdout      (if there is space in command i need to exit inside the first_command)

# exit 126   ( command was found but could not be executed )
- valgrind ./pipex filein "cat" "./mad" /dev/stdout   (create mad to see the "not executable message")
-  ./pipex filein cat "/home/eamchart/Desktop/pipx/pipex" /dev/stdout


valgrind ./pipex filein "." " " /dev/stdout             mmm first command does not print

# hard to handle
./pipex file1 "invalidcmd" "wc -l" file2
Expected: Print an error like command not found: invalidcmd and exit with status 127

# double free / memory leak
PATH=.:$PATH ./pipex filein "./mad" "wc -l" fileout  (FIX IT: ))
 valgrind ./pipex filein "/bin/cat" " . " fileout         mmmm memory leak (./usr/local/sbin/.  path2 returns this)
valgrind ./pipex filein "dfdls" "ls" /dev/stdout            (if last command true , path = /usr/bin/ls needs to be freed)
valgrind  ./pipex /dev/stdin "/" "ls" /dev/stdout         MMM /

# bonus
./bpipex here_doc abc "cat" "grep hi" uniq sort  output.txt
./bpipex here_doc RANDOM "head -c 10 /dev/random" "hexdump" uniq sort output.txt
./bpipex here_doc BLOCK "cat /dev/random" "head -c 10" uniq sort output.txt
./bpipex input.txt "grep bar" "sort" "head -n 5" output.txt
./bpipex /dev/null "cat" "wc -l" output.txt
./bpipex input.txt "cat" "grep foo" "sort" "uniq" "head -n 10" output.txt
./bpipex filein "cat" "xargs echo" output.txt
./bpipex filein "/home/eamchart/Desktop/pipex" "/ls" /dev/stdout  (command not executable)
./bpipex filein "ls" "cat" "grep hi" output.txt           (just to test someone confusion lol )

./bpipex /dev/random cat "head -n 5" output.txt       NOT WORKING
